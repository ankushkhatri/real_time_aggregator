üß† Real-Time Aggregator ‚Äì Architecture & Service Breakdown
1. crypto_ingestor (or ingestion_service)
üì¶ Directory: ingestion_service/
üë∑ Role: Real-time Data Producer
Connects to a public crypto WebSocket API (like Binance).

Listens for price updates for symbols like BTCUSDT.

Stores the latest price into Redis with a key like price:BTCUSDT.

This ensures that the latest price is always available to consumers.

Command:
CMD ["python", "crypto_ws_ingestor.py"]

2. api_service
üì¶ Directory: api_service/app/
üë®‚Äçüíª Role: Real-time WebSocket API Server
Built using FastAPI with a WebSocket route.

On client connection, reads the latest price from Redis for a symbol.

Continuously pushes updates over WebSocket to connected clients.

Key file: ws_routes.py
Handles client WebSocket connections and data pushing.

3. dashboard_service
üì¶ Directory: dashboard_service/
üìä Role: Frontend Dashboard (optional)
Could be a simple web app (in Flask, React, etc.) that connects to the WebSocket endpoint and shows price graphs or updates.

Currently placeholder, can be expanded into a full-featured dashboard.

Future work: Add a WebSocket client in browser to show live updates.

4. worker_service
üì¶ Directory: worker_service/
‚öôÔ∏è Role: Background Task Processor
Can be used for analytics, alerting, or processing historical data.

Subscribes to Redis Pub/Sub or fetches from Redis keys periodically.

Performs computations like price trends, moving averages, etc.

Future idea: Save processed results in a DB or send notifications.

5. redis
üì¶ Image: redis:7
üß† Role: In-memory data store & message broker
Stores real-time prices (price:BTCUSDT) from the ingestor.

Acts as the central communication hub between services.

Used for both:

Key-value store (latest price)

Optional Pub/Sub (if needed later)

### Real-Time Aggregator ‚Äì Service Overview

**1. crypto_ingestor**
- Role: Ingests real-time crypto price via WebSocket API.
- Writes latest price to Redis (keyed as `price:<symbol>`).

**2. api_service**
- Role: WebSocket server built using FastAPI.
- Clients connect via WebSocket and receive live prices.
- Reads from Redis every few seconds and sends to connected clients.

**3. dashboard_service**
- Role: Placeholder frontend to visualize price data.
- Can connect to `api_service` WebSocket and render in a UI.

**4. worker_service**
- Role: Background processing or analytics service.
- Can process real-time/historical data, compute trends, etc.

**5. redis**
- Role: Shared in-memory store and broker.
- Used to store real-time price data and optionally Pub/Sub streams.

Dashboard service
- Frontend (index.html) connects to WebSocket.
- Django Channels handles WebSocket at /ws/live-data/.
- Consumer reads prices from Redis on interval or pub/sub.
- Prices are pushed live to frontend via WebSocket.
